//pseudo code
//A game with 4 crystals and randomly generated numbers.
//Random number generated by computer is between 19 - 120.
//Every crystal needs to have a random number between 1 - 12.
//The number is generated every time there is a win or loss to the 4 crystals.
//When clicking a crystal it will add to the previous result.
//Until it equals the random number.
//If is greater than the random number, loss counter will decrement by 1.
//If it is equal, then the win counter is increased by one.
